# Directive-deep-dive
Just a small reminder for myself, an small application that shows some changes depending on structural (ngFor, ngStyle) and attribute directives (ngClass, ngStyle). Also build with an own basic attribute directive (basic-highlight). HostListener that listen to host events or HostBinding that bind to host properties (better-highlight for changes on hover). In an other way with binding to directive properties was the same result but just made it possible to be listenable from outside of the component to overwrite there. And the last is a build structural directive (app.component.html) under the comment.
